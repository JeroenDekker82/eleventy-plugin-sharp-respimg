# eleventy-plugin-sharp-respimg
An Eleventy [paired shortcode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/#paired-shortcodes) which transforms large sized images into resized `.jpeg` and `.webp` formats and generates `<picture>` tags for responsive images.

## What does it do?
It turns paired shortcodes like this:

```js
{% respimage 
    "photo.jpg", 
    "Some alt text", 
    "./images/",
    { small: 320, med: 640, large: 1024 },
    "(min-width: 450px) 33.3vw, 100vw",
%}{% endrespimage %}
```

into responsive image markup using `<picture>` tags like this:

```html
 <picture>
    <source 
        type="image/webp"
        srcSet="/images/photo-large.webp 1024w,
                /images/photo-med.webp 640w,
                /images/photo-small.webp 320w"
        sizes="(min-width: 450px) 33.3vw, 100vw"
    >
    <img 
        srcSet='/images/photo-large.jpg 1024w,
                /images/photo-med.jpg 640w,
                /images/photo-small.jpg 320w'
        sizes='(min-width: 450px) 33.3vw, 100vw'
        src='photo-small.jpg'
        alt='Some alt text'
        loading='lazy'
    >
</picture>
```
- The images are responsive by using a `<picture>` element which contains zero or more `<source>` elements and one `<img>` element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios. 
- Using `srcset` and `sizes`, the `<picture>` and `<img>` tags deliver [variable-resolution images](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/responsive-images-done-right-guide-picture-srcset/), which respond to variable layout widths and screen densities.

## Transform mulitple images from other data sources
The real power of using paired shortcodes is the ability to use data from [global data files](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-global/) or [front matter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-frontmatter/) as arguments.

If you have global JSON data `data.json` which is an array of objects like this,

```json
[
    {
        "src": "car.jpg",
        "imgDir": "./images/",
        "alt": "A picture of a car",
        "sizes": "(min-width: 450px) 33.3vw, 100vw",
        "widths": {
            "small": "320",
            "med": "640",
            "large": "1024"
        }
    },
    {
        "src": "flower.jpg",
        "imgDir": "./images/",
        "alt": "A picture of a flower",
        "sizes": "(min-width: 450px) 33.3vw, 100vw",
        "widths": {
            "small": "320",
            "med": "640",
            "large": "1024"
        }
    }
]
```
you can use the paired shortcode to transform multiple images into responsive image markup using a `for` loop like this,

```js
{% for image in data %}
    {% respimage 
        item.src, 
        item.alt, 
        item.imgDir,
        item.widths, 
        item.sizes 
    %}{% endrespimage %}
{% endfor %}
```

## Notes
- Use `./` when declaring the image directory parameter as Sharp expects this.
- The `<picture>` and `<img>` tags generated by the paired shortcode don't have any styling out of the box. But they can be manipulated with a bit of CSS to apply different `width` or `height` attributes.

## TODO
- [ ] Add support for more custom widths, currently only supports (1024, 640, 320)
- [ ] If an image is smaller than 1024px, figure out what sizes to resize too or whether images must be larger than 1024px to perform image transformations.
- [ ] Possibly remove widths and make the parameter optional where the default width values are (1024, 640, 320) and once support is added could utilize more widths like (200, 300, 400, etc) if needed.
